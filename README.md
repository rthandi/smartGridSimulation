# smartGridSimulation

The code repo used to simulate and extract data for my 4th year dissertation and subsequent published paper (available at https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/article-3432.pdf)

The current setup uses Paillier's cryptosystem in order to manage the homomorphic encryption and ciphertext operations. This was analysed to be the best method for this project but switch to the FHE branch to try out a fully homomorphic encryption system using microsoft SEAL to compare the feasibility of utilising a FHE encryption system instead.
